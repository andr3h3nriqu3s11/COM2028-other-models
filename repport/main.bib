abstract = {Abstract To understand the physiology and pathology of disease, capturing the heterogeneity of cell types within their tissue environment is fundamental. In such an endeavor, the human kidney presents a formidable challenge because its complex organizational structure is tightly linked to key physiological functions. Advances in imaging-based cell classification may be limited by the need to incorporate specific markers that can link classification to function. Multiplex imaging can mitigate these limitations, but requires cumulative incorporation of markers, which may lead to tissue exhaustion. Furthermore, the application of such strategies in large scale 3-dimensional (3D) imaging is challenging. Here, we propose that 3D nuclear signatures from a DNA stain, DAPI, which could be incorporated in most experimental imaging, can be used for classifying cells in intact human kidney tissue. We developed an unsupervised approach that uses 3D tissue cytometry to generate a large training dataset of nuclei images (NephNuc), where each nucleus is associated with a cell type label. We then devised various supervised machine learning approaches for kidney cell classification and demonstrated that a deep learning approach outperforms classical machine learning or shape-based classifiers. Specifically, a custom 3D convolutional neural network (NephNet3D) trained on nuclei image volumes achieved a balanced accuracy of 80.26\%. Importantly, integrating NephNet3D classification with tissue cytometry allowed in situ visualization of cell type classifications in kidney tissue. In conclusion, we present a tissue cytometry and deep learning approach for in situ classification of cell types in human kidney tissue using only a DNA stain. This methodology is generalizable to other tissues and has potential advantages on tissue economy and non-exhaustive classification of different cell types.},

abstract={A rapid increase in brain tumor cases mandates researchers for the automation of brain tumor detection and diagnosis. Multi-tumor brain image classification became a contemporary research task due to the diverse characteristics of tumors. Recently, deep neural networks are commonly used for medical image classification to assist neurologists. Vanishing gradient problem and overfitting are the demerits of the deep networks. In this paper, we have proposed a deep network model that uses ResNet-50 and global average pooling to resolve the vanishing gradient and overfitting problems. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model simulation has been carried out using a three-tumor brain magnetic resonance image dataset consisting of 3064 images. Key performance metrics have used to analyze the performance of the proposed model and its competitive models. We have achieved a mean accuracy of 97.08{\%} and 97.48{\%} with data augmentation and without data augmentation, respectively. Our proposed model outperforms existing models in classification accuracy.},

abstract = {Retinal imaging plays the most significant roles among all the medical imaging technology, because of its ability to derive various features that is related to various eye diseases. Thus, precise extraction is highly required for the blood vessels that lead to accurate identification of the diseases. Because of some instabilities in the retinal images such as noise, non-uniform illumination etc. it may motivate towards a false detection. This paper suggests an automated method to extract the blood vessels from fundus by integrating discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with Tyler Coye algorithm. Furthermore, in the retinal blood vessel segmentation methods the most vital step is to enhance the contrast. The authenticity of the segmentation is purely subjected to the uniformity of the contrast over the image. Thus, an illumination normalization technique known as Gamma correction is also utilized for the contrast enhancement. Three different types of experiments are carried out: original Tyler Coye algorithm, DWT with different wavelet filters integrated with Tyler Coye, and Gamma correction normalization applied to the integrated model. The approaches are tested with DRIVE dataset. The performance of the normalization-integrated model is found superior to the other two approaches.}
